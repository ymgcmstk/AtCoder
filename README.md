This repository is for AtCoder Contest.

To generate the directory for a contest, move to `./tools` and run the script `prepare.py` like below.
`python prepare.py http://arc001.contest.atcoder.jp`

Then, move to the generated directory, write the code and compile it.

You can test your compiled file by running the script `./tools/test.py`.
In my case, I write the following line on my bash_profile and run the command on the directory for each problem.
`alias actest='python /path/to/your/rep/tools/test.py'`
